3. Alert Feature

Typical security plugins will have their classic way of detecting malicious payloads and blocking them but we understand how hackers operate and how they change their techniques with time. That's why using our plugin you can set your own set of payloads that will generate alerts for you which gives you a massive advantage over the hackers.

For example, you know that <b>"%3Chack%3E"</b> is a malicious payload and hackers can use it to exploit your website. So you can set it as an alert, and whenever someone tries to access it you will get notified. You can easily block those IPs afterward.

4. Block IPs



If you find malicious logs from an IP or multiple IPs you can select all and block them.
